# Python - Object-relational mapping

In this project, I learned about how object-relational mapping is used for database scripting. I became familiar with using MySQLdb and SQLAlchemy to query, create, edit, and delete tables in MySQL.


## Tasks ðŸ“ƒ
- 0. Get all states
     - [0-select_states.py](https://github.com/richard-1257/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x0F-python-object_relational_mapping/0-select_states.py):  Python script that uses MySQLdb to list all states in the database `hbtn_0e_0_usa`.
     - Usage: `./0-select_states.py <mysql username> <mysql password> <database name>`.
     - Results are ordered by ascending `states.id`.
     
- 1. Filter states
     - [1-filter_states.py](https://github.com/richard-1257/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x0F-python-object_relational_mapping/1-filter_states.py): Python script that uses MySQLdb to list all states with names starting with `N` in the database `hbtn_0e_0_usa`.
     - Usage: `./1-filter_states.py <mysql username> <mysql password> <database name>`.
     - Results are ordered by ascending `states.id`.
     
- 2. Filter states by user input
     - [2-my_filter_states.py](https://github.com/richard-1257/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x0F-python-object_relational_mapping/2-my_filter_states.py): Python script that uses MySQLdb to display all values matching a given name in the `states` table of the database `hbtn_0e_0_usa`.
     - Usage: `./2-my_filter_states.py <mysql username> <mysql password> <database name> <state name searched>`.
     - Results are ordered by ascending `states.id`.
     - Uses string formatting to construct the SQL query.

- 3. SQL Injection...
     - [3-my_safe_filter_states.py](https://github.com/richard-1257/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x0F-python-object_relational_mapping/3-my_safe_filter_states.py): Python script that uses MySQLdb to display all values matching a given name in the `states` table of the database `hbtn_0e_0_usa`.
     - Usage: `./3-my_safe_filter_states.py <mysql username> <mysql password> <database name> <state name searched>`.
     - Results are ordered by ascending `states.id`.
     - Safe from SQL injections.

- 5. All cities by state

     - Usage: `./5-filter_cities.py <mysql username> <mysql password> <database name>`.
     - Results are sorted by ascending `cities.id`.
     
- 6. Counting sort
     - [102-counting_sort.c](https://github.com/richard-1257/sorting_algorithms/blob/master/102-counting_sort.c): C function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Counting Sort algorithm.
     - Assumes that the array will only contain numbers `>= 0`.
     - Prints the counting array after it has been initialized.
     - [102-O](https://github.com/richard-1257/sorting_algorithms/blob/master/102-O): Text file containing the best, average, and worst case time complexities of the Counting Sort algorithm, one per line.
     
- 7. Merge sort
     - [103-merge_sort.c](https://github.com/richard-1257/sorting_algorithms/blob/master/103-merge_sort.c): C function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Merge Sort algorithm.
     - Implements the `top-down` Merge Sort algorithm
         - When an array is divided, the size of the left subarray is always less than or equal to the size of the right subarray.
         - Always sorts the left subarray before the right one.
     - Prints subarrays each time they are merged.

     - Assumes that the array will only contain numbers `>= 0`.
     - Prints the array for each significant digit increase.

      - Assumes that `size` is a power of 2 (ie. `size` can be expressed as `2^k` where `k >= 0`).
      - Prints subarrays each time they are merged.
      - [106-O](https://github.com/richard-1257/sorting_algorithms/blob/master/106-O): Text file containing the best, average, and worst case time complexities of the Bitonic Sort algorithm, one per line.

      - Implements the Hoare partition scheme.
      - Always uses the last elemement of the partition being sorted as the pivot.
      - Prints the array after each swap.

      - [1000-sort_deck.c](https://github.com/richard-1257/sorting_algorithms/blob/master/1000-sort_deck.c): C function that sorts a `deck_node_t` doubly-linked list deck of cards.
      - Assumes that there are exactly 52 elements in the doubly-linked list.
