# Python - Network #1

This project involved learning how to use the `urllib` and `requests` Python libraries to send and receive HTTP messages to URL's. I practiced sending `GET` and `POST` requests, fetching JSON resources, and interacting with API's (the Star Wars API, GitHub API, and Twitter API).
