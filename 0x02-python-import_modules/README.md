# Python - import & modules
In this project, I learned about importing and using functions and creating modules in Python. I further practiced using the builtin function `dir()` and using command line arguments within Python programs.

## Tasks ðŸ“ƒ
+ [x] 0. **Import a simple function from a simple file**<br/>[0-add.py](0-add.py) :Python program that imports the function `def add(a, b):` from the file [0-add.py](0-add.py) and prints the result of the addition `1 + 2 = 3`.
  + Output: `<a value> + <b value> = <add(a, b) value>` followed by a new line.

+ [x] 1. **My first toolbox!**<br/>[1-calculation.py](1-calculation.py) Python program that imports functions from the file [calculator_1.py](calculator_1.py) and prints the result of the addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of `10` and `5.`
  + Output: `<a value> <operator> <b value> = <operation(a, b) value>` followed by a new line.

+ [x] 2. **How to make a script dynamic!**<br/>[2-args.py](2-args.py) Python program that prints the number of and list of its arguments.
  + Output: `[Number of arguments] argument` (if number is one) or `arguments` (otherwise), followed by:
    + `:` (or `.` if no argumets were passed), followed by
    + A new line, followed by
    + One argument per line - the position of the argument (starting at `1`) followed by `:` followed by the argument value and another new line.
   
+ [x] 3. **Infinite addition**<br/>[3-infinite_add.py](3-infinite_add.py) : Python program that prints the result of the addition of all arguments.
  + Output: Sum of the arguments followed by a new line.
